    <p>   HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely
        used language to write Web Pages. Hypertext refers to the way in which
        Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link
        available on a webpage is called Hypertext. As its name suggests, HTML
        is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a
        text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to
        display. Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining
        the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so
        forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between
        researchers.</p>
